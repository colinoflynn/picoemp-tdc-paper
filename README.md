# Repository for PicoEMP & TDC Testing Paper

This is an anonymous version of information being released with the paper under consideration.

Note the actual repository includes seperate repositores for the PicoEMP design and the iCE40 design. Both of these are being released.

This anonymous version has been combined from those. All names have been removed (including in PDFs and images) so you can safely browse this data. The source PCB files & gerbers may not be fully anonymized due to limitations in editing those files.
