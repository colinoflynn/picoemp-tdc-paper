# Repository for PicoEMP & TDC Testing Paper

This is an anonymous version of information being released with the paper under consideration.

Note the actual release includes seperate repositores for the PicoEMP design and the iCE40 design. Both of these are being released, but for convience here they are linked as one anonymous repository.

This anonymous version has been combined from those. All names have been removed (including in PDFs and images) so you can safely browse this data. The source PCB files & gerbers may not be fully anonymized due to limitations in editing those files.

## PicoEMP Firmware

The included repository has a basic micropython firmware that was used for this work. Additional work to build new firmware is outside the scope of this paper.
