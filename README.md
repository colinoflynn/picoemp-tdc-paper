# Repository for PicoEMP: A Low-Cost EMFI Platform Compared to BBI and Voltage Fault Injection using TDC and External VCC Measurements

This repository contains:

* Design of an iCE40 TDC described in the above paper.
* Additional data used to generate figures in the paper, useful for performing comparisons

This repository was originally an anonymous version of the PicoEMP repository as well, used for the paper review. This can be seen in the GIT history, but the PicoEMP designed is stored in [another repository](https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp). There may still be a few anonymous things as this repo is further cleaned up.

The paper is to be presented at FDTC 2023 on Septemer 10, 2023.

### PicoEMP differences in paper

Note the paper used only some of the basic PicoEMP features, and did not require the more advanced firmware. The more advanced firmware was written by @stacksmashing and can be seen in the [PicoEMP Repo](https://github.com/newaetech/chipshouter-picoemp).
